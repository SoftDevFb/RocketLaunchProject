# RocketLaunchProject
You will be using the API provided by Launch Library webservice to access the next 5 rocket launches. You will have a countdown timer to the next launch and provide links to filter the launches by Falcon, Ariene or Launcher One.

Extra tidbit: You do NOT NEED to incorporate a php file as you did in the example from the book. You should be able to put the get request directly into your XMLRequest.open method. You also do NOT need a unique key.
